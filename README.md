## Problem

## Requirements

Create a basic application that allows a user to fetch and update a bill of materials, using the
supplied bill of materials items JSON. A bill of materials is a list of the parts and the quantities
that a customer uses in their product. Each bill of materials (or Bom) has bom items which are
electronic components like this one with a specific quantity.

The API calls should use the mock API endpoint below and bom_id “1001”. A user interface that
allows the bill of material data to be modified should be implemented. This should be able to
update the modified bill of materials by making a PUT request to the mock API endpoint.

## How to run the project:

- Install Node and NPM package manager from the official site
- Open terminal and go to the directory of the project
- Run following commands : - npm install - npm start
- Navigate to "http://localhost:3000" on your browser.
